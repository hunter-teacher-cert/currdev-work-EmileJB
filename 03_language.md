When I was initially planning my theoretical course,  I thought that it would make sense to use Flask. I have experience with Flask and there are some aspects of flask that I really like,  like how it interacts with jinja. However, what I don't like about Flask is that it is python based. While I don't have any problems with Python in and of itself and actually like the language,  if teaching a class on web development having students need to learn and know python  in addition to JavaScript and whatever other languages would end up being used seems like a bit of a tall order. I knew that Node.js existed and could potentially fill a role of a more backend language for this theoretical class but the problem was that I didn't have any experience working with Node. I didn't get to do any fully in-depth research but I played around with it a bit on the W3Schools site as well as doing a bit on repl.it A bit of experience with it and see what my thoughts on it were.  After trying it out, I think it could be a better fit for this class than flask is. The biggest benefit of using Node over Flask  to me is that the node syntax is pretty close to the JavaScript syntax, which students would definitely be learning in a web development course.  Thus, we wouldn't have to put too much time or effort into learning a new language and maintaining knowledge of how to use multiple languages. I do think one weakness however,  especially when comparing these two options,  is that also it might be easier for students to get started working with Node,  some of the things we might want to do in the class might be harder to achieve using node then they might be using Flask. In this class, Node would be just one of a few languages used,  along with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, so students would need a programming environment that could handle multiple languages easily.  It's maybe not the most elegant choice,  but I think GitHub CodeSpaces  or even just GitHub Dev could be good options especially considering GitHub has GitHub Pages.
