One of the things I dislike about how grades are currently done is that there is so much focus on the numbers. Students will share the grades they got with each other and they might decree to one another that they both got 91s. That’s certainly a great score but by simpleing it down to a number there is a loss of information along the way. More than likely, even if these students got the same grade they didn’t get it in the same way. For instance, one student may have a 91 because they got around that score on all their assignments, while another may have that score because they got 100s on all of their assignments but maybe a 60 or 70 on one test or project. Point being that there is a story that makes up these grades and I would like for that story to be not so easily forgotten.

I think my ideal grading system is a standards or mastery based one, although with the potential to be converted to other more traditional point-based grading systems. Although I’m not sure how exactly I would do it, I think that it would be important to be able to break the grade down into subcategories of some sort. The reference idea that comes to mind is the SAT, and how you could say that you got 2100 on the SAT it would be more accurate to say you got an 800 on math, 700 on reading, and 600 on writing (I do know this is not how the SAT is scored anymore). I think having those divisions in the grade reports might make it more readily apparent and memorable what areas students might need to work on, or which ones students already have a solid grasp on. In addition to that, I am a fan of students having ongoing knowledge of their grades like through learning management systems, weekly reports, or any other method. That way, students not only aren’t surprised by their grades but they’re also able to easily see what assignments may be missing or need extra work. In the context of a standard or mastery based grading system, how students are meeting each standard so far would be visible and it would also be apparent what assignments correspond to what standards.

On a per assignment basis, I think I would be very transparent when it comes to grading. I would make sure that for any assignment complex enough to require it, I would share the grading rubric with students in advance and maybe even explain the reasoning behind the choices of the grading rubric if desired. Rather than saying any test or project got a single grade I would say how it scored on each criteria of the rubric and let them do the math to convert it to a 100 point scale themselves if they want. I imagine that students' overall grades would be based off of projects, tests/quizzes, homework, and participation. I’d like to put the most focus on projects with the second most on tests, but I would make it so that students can increase their test grade through corrections even after the exam. I pondered what the role of HW in grading was in class and after giving it some thought I think it does make sense to have HW factor into the grade, even if only a small percentage and to act as incentive to do HW. After all, HW should be designed to help students learn and practice but that might not be readily apparent to the students themselves so it helps to have another incentive for them to attempt their HW. Theoretically, I would like to design HW in a way such that it can be a resource for them as well, potentially also doubling as a study guide or a reference. Finally, I know how I am as a student myself and I know that I really want the grades to measure how well the student can use what they learned in the class so I would try to be as tolerant and lenient as possible lateness.
