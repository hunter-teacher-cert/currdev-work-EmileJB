## Course Sequence
1. HTML/CSS
2. Javascript
3. Flask (Or Node or something else)
4. Databases (via SQL)
5. APIs and Libraries

### Reasoning
The idea behind this sequence of units is for students to be able to build up the complexity of the sites they'll be creating. While APIs and Libraries could come earlier in the sequence using that logic (like by introducing JQuery as part of the Javascript unit) but I do have a reason for putting it near the end. Anyways, HTML/CSS are the first unit because they are required to make the simplest websites. Javascript would come next as that would be a way for students to add interactivity to their websites. The Flask unit (which could be subsituted for other languages potentially like Node JS but I would need to do more research on this) would be the way of introducing the concept of a "back end" to students. It could also be a way to show students another way of more programmatically adding HTML and CSS code to a website. I think SQL is nice to have as a unit because it is a very different type of language than what students might be used to. While SQL and working with data might not be that flashy, I think that seeing how data and queries can help build a website will show students the potential of uses of data and using SQL to interact with that data. It would also inform how data and websites/apps are related, such as with data associated with user accounts or posts on sites like YouTube or Instagram.
