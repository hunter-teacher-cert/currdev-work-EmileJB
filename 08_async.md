When I was developing my unit plan,  one of the  decisions I had to make was how students would actually be doing their work. Right off the bat two options came to mind. There was the option that I was more familiar with and have even used myself on multiple occasions, GitHub.  while the primary purpose of GitHub is not to act as an IDE, GitHub Dev and potentially even GitHub CodeSpaces are ways that students could theoretically code in the browser and have all of their files stored online so that if they wanted to work on it at home they could very easily do so. In addition to being a potential online IDE, GitHub is of course also obviously GitHub and has all the features that come with it and by getting students familiarized with it now it could be beneficial to them down the line. Most notably in the context of my potential class was the fact that there are also GitHub pages so students could even host the website they ended up making and share them with others if they so wished.  However, one of the flaws of using GitHub in this way is that it’s  a bit harder to see what you're actually doing. If you're working on a website, to see changes in that website you need to commit the changes you just made, however minor they may be, and actually wait for the GitHub pages to update which could take a while especially depending on the complexity of the project.  There are ways to kind of get around this problem but those require a bit of extra setup upfront.

The other option I considered was Glitch. I had  actually only heard of glitch because of Andy's presentation in our methods II class, but it seemed  almost exactly what I was looking for. In addition to having a bit of a more catching aesthetic,  one of the biggest benefits of using Glitch would be that students would be able to see the result of any changes they make in their programs almost instantly. Glitch also seems like it was a bit easier to start up for the first time and use. In addition, Glitch had remix features that would be great for providing students with starter code. Glitch sites could also be hosted on the web so they could also be shared with others. Glitch was actually looking like the perfect resource but the major problem I had with Glitch was that it used this weird assets system for anything that wasn't in HTML JavaScript or CSS file.  if you wanted to include an image in your glitch project for example,  you would have to put it in this weird asset system and then you would have to use a URL for that image instead of just using the file path for that image.  it's a relatively minor thing but I think that it took quite a bit away from the potential web development experience. It would make some potential project designs harder than they’d need to be and potentially necessitate unrealistic procedures to get around it. There seem to maybe be some ways around this as well, but the effort it would take to circumvent this design decision kinda betrays one of Glitch’s strengths of its ease of use. 

I think that both are still of course amazing resources but which one you choose might depend on how in-depth, how in the weeds you want your students to be with their projects.  If the goal is to maybe just have students dip their toes into HTML CSS and JavaScript, Glitch seems like a fantastic tool for that. GitHub may be better for classes that want to give students a bit more control and more to work with.
