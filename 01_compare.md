The two curricula I reviewed were the CS50 curriculum and the CodeHS Python curriculum. The two are pretty similar in how they begin the APCSP curriculum and what they focus on throughout the curriculum. Both have a strong focus on teaching and developing students programming skills throughout the year so that they can produce computational artifacts related to whatever the relevant topics are. Both start with a sort of intro language before quickly transitioning students into more traditional, written programming language like Python. Both also feature detailed assignments throughout the curriculum and describe what computational thinking and big ideas each one targets. While there are probably more similarities that can be discusses, the last one I want to mention now is that both intend for students to use the IDE maintained by the respective websites as CodeHS and CS50 have their own IDEs.
While the two curricula have a focus on programming, they go about it in notably different ways. CodeHS's curriculum starts with Karel but then focuses on Python afterwards while CS50's curriculum covers Scratch, C, Python, HTML, CSS, Flask, and SQL. Furthermore, while I mentioned that both put an emphasis on assignments, how they do so differs as well. The CS50 curriculum seems to be made almost entirely of assignments related to the overall learning goals of each chapter, and the assignments seem to be a way for students to learn the material. On the other hand, CodeHS's curriculum assignment focus is more on mini-units between some units where students take a few days to work on assignments meant to be practice for the AP Create Performance Task. Going into more detail about the assignments, the CS50 curriculums provides an exact list of assignments throughout the course, what students are supposed to do, and what they should get out of it while the CodeHS curriculum only describes some of the assignments that may appear throughout the course, and even those are listed as examples. While the CodeHS curriclum does seem to focus more on the programming aspect of AP CSP, it does get to all of the big ideas mentioned in the general description. In matter of fact, many aspects of the curriculum such as the practice performance tasks and the built in week of exam review seem designed ensure students are prepared for what's expected of them in the AP Exam. Contrast this with the CS50 curriculum, which seems to focus more on developing students skills in various programming languages and has some aspects of the AP CSP couse description as afterthoughts, implemented as modules that were not considered in the sequential flow of the curriculum.
Both curricula say that no intro CS knowledge is required (although they do recommend Algebra 1). However, I feel like the CS50 curriculum could maybe benefit from having a prerequisite introductory course. The curriculum covers so many languages while not even fully considering all the aspects of AP Computer Science Principals; it seems very ambitious but I would be worried about successfully getting through everything in the curriculum in a timely manner, especially considering it doesn't mention the expected time for each chapter or assignment. I actually do like the idea of the curriculum, but maybe with some trimming. I feel that the CodeHS curriculum would be much more manageable while still giving students a good foundation in programming and better delivering more of the AP Computer Science Principles learning objectives (although it could probably still use some work in IOC and CSN). While the CS50 curriculum is more straightforward and on the rails. which is a pro in its own way, I like how the CodeHS curriculum doesn't spell everything out but does give examples of assignments you might give as well as thoughtful questions you might give your students. The fact that each unit has an estimate for how much time it should take and that students work towards building a portfolio throughout the year, including a few weeks at the end dedicated to making their own final projects, are things I view favorably as well. Overall though, I think it's been very helpful for me to see just how different two curricula for the same class can be, it sort of relieves a bit of pressure to know that there isn't just 1 right way to build a curriculum.
