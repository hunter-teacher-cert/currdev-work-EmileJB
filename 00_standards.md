## Course Idea
For the assignment this week, I was thinking of a class that focused on students developing a single, bigger-scope project rather than multiple smaller ones that's more common for CS classes. As such, I imagine this would probably be a junior or senior level course, probably after students have taken APCS. I feel like Web Development is an area of CS that could facilitate this idea nicely. What I like about Web Development as a focus for this class is that there is a lot of potential for learning about different CS topics, like front-end, back-end, databases, APIs, etc. (part of the reason it would be a higher level course). Students would have a lot of room to express themselves creatively through the course. The fact that students would be working on making their own websites could not only give them experience for the future, but also potentially something for their portfolios. While this class would focus on web development, like previously mentioned, I would want to also put emphasis on teaching students how they might want to go about planning and creating bigger projects, using multiple subsets of CS, and working with others, That way, they have practical skills that might be useful in the future in a broader scope, like if they wanted to work on developing a game for instance.
