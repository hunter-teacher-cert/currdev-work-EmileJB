# Intro to HTML and CSS
by Emile Jean Baptiste

## General Overview
This unit is an introduction to HTML and CSS. This unit was designed to be part of a class that covers multiple aspects of Web Development, including JavaScript and SQL, so it does not go too in depth into HTML or CSS as a class focused on those languages might. This class was originally meant to be maybe a senior level class, but I tried to make it a bit more accessible to students of different CS experience, although I still envision this being a class students take after an intro CS class. This unit in particular was designed with project-based learning in mind, with students having a small project made in most lessons while also building towards the goal of a larger-scale project of their own machinations.

## Motivation for Unit
The thing that I love about Computer Science the most is its versatility and potential for creativity. Although I was never a professional, web development is one of the aspects of computer science I like doing the most and one that I think has a lot of potential for intersecting with other fields. One of the central philosophies I has in mind while developing this unit was that I really wanted to not only show off various different applications of what they'd be learning, HTML and CSS, but I also wanted to give students a chance at every opportunity to really make the work in this class their own and be something that matters to them, even if it's just because they got to use an image they liked once. I also wanted this to be a class where students felt like they had a bit of control of the direction the class takes and what they learn from it. The class has a relatively consistent structure of watch me and the slides for a bit, and then do something (hopefully) fun. While I realize in retrospect that there may not be enough time to finish assignments by the end of each class, I also made it so that these assignments were the only HW as to hopefully not be too stressful of a class. I focused on HTML and CSS as a unit because I thought it would be easier to work with what would likely be the first unit in the curriculum, and I wouldn't have to worry too much about thinking what would students theoretically know in the middle of the year.
