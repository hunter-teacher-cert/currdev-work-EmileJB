### Aim:  How do we use GitHub?

### Lesson Goals
Throughout the course, students will use GitHub to receive scaffolded code/templates, submit coding assignments, and host their projects on the web. Students may also decide to use GitHub for other purposes outside this class or once the class is over (my own GitHub was made for school). However, GitHub can be quite complex to learn at first and get adjusted to. Furthermore, it is important to be present for extra help or guidance as needed to make sure that students are ready to do the work for future lessons. Thus, this entire class period will be dedicated to trying to make sure every student has their GitHub account ready as well as a bare minimum knowledge of the features important for this class. In particular, students need to
1. Create a GitHub account if they don't have one already
2. Accept an assignment from GitHub Classroom so that they are on the roster
3. Learn how to use the GitHub Developer feature on the web (Technically optional, but potentially easier than alternatives)
4. Commit and push their changes to their repositories
5. Publish their project using GitHub Pages
 

### Activity
Students will follow the directions given on Google Classroom and shown on the board in class. Those directions are
1. If you do not already have a GitHub account, follow the steps to create a new GitHub account
2. Sign into your GitHub account
3. Go to Google Classroom, navigate to the work for today, click on the GitHub classroom link and follow the prompts
4. In your repository, go to Settings -> Pages -> Deploy (from main, root folder)
5. Wait a bit, then refresh the page to see the link to your assignment on the web
6. Afterwards, go back to the code tab and press the "." key
7. Navigate to the file named index.html [provided in code/lesson01/index.html] and answer the questions in the file in the field provided
8. Go to the button on the side named Source Control and then press the Commit & Push button. Make sure to include a message.
9. Go back to the URL for your assignment (if you didn't save or copy it, you can get to the link again by going to the Page part of settings). It may take a bit to see the changes to your page
10. Once you see the changes on your web page that you made, copy the link to your webpage and post it for the Google Classroom assignment for today
