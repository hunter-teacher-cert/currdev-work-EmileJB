Students will be given 2-3 minutes to write down their answers.

### Warm-Up Review (3-5 minutes)
After students are given some time to do the Do Now, we'll turn this into a classwide discussion, taking time to hear students' answers. This will be used to segue into the slides for today's lesson.

### Slide Presentation (20-25 minutes)
Present the slides provided in the materials

The slides for this lesson will cover
- div tag
- HTML Box Model

- example/explanation of what students will be working on next

In addition to the slides, live demo
- divs with CSS vs divs without CSS
- different parts of the box model, especially border and margin
- an example of what the activity for today might look like 


### Activity: Creating a Comic (Rest of Class)
For today's activity students will practice using divs by creating a 4 panel comic using HTML and CSS. Students assignments will need to meet these requirements (which will be in a readme in their starter code) but are welcome to go beyond them 
- Creating a div to act as a container for the comic itself
- Adding at least 4 divs inside the container to be the panels
- Style each panel using CSS, giving each one at least width,height,background-color/background-image, and border properties
- Inside each panel, include at least one image and at least one text tag
- Make sure to change at least one of the text, image, or image CSS properties between panels 
Students are free to use any school appropriate images they want for this project, but some images will also be provided for students who don't want to think too much about it or get right to coding (located in resources). If students don't end up finishing in class, they will finish it as Homework
