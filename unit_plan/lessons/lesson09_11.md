## Lesson Structure
### Aim:  Working on Personal Website Project

### Assignment Details
Students will spend 3 days in class (and time out of class if they wish) working on their Personal Website Projects. This will be an ongoing project throughout the course that they will revist at the end of each unit, with this being their first time working on it.

Students will see examples of what their websites could potentially be (examples shown in Resources below and would realistically include prior student work as well if it existed). While they won't be able to recreate all the examples shown right away, this will maybe inspire them to go in certain directions with their websites. Since I don't expect students to know exactly what they will want to do for their websites by this point, the assignment will instead focus on getting them started with an About Me page, A Portfolio page containing links to their previous works, and a home page that for now can be whatever they want it to (the home page at this point is more for navigational purposes)

In additon, students will be expected to turn in a journal of sorts to Google Classroom at the end of the week. The journal doesn't have any specified length, but students should write about their process so far making their websites, such as why they made the design choices they did, what troubles did they encounter, what did they realize they want to add to their website now, etc.

When grading this assignment, I will be checking for
- If the basic structure tags are properly used for each page
- If images are used for the About Me page (it doesn't have to be them, but it should be something they can relate to)
- There are links to go from the home page, about me page, and portfolio page on all three pages
- The portfolio page contains links to the assignments they worked on so far, with each assignment being in its own div
- Students make use of CSS throughout the site, including
    - colors
    - text-styling
    - use of positioning or the display property
