### Activity: Styling Dialogue (Rest of Class)
For today's activity students will practice using text styling by styling dialogue. The dialogue can come from anywhere. A sample text will be provided for students who want to get to coding right away while https://imsdb.com/ will also be provided as an option for students to browse if they want to take dialogue from a movie they enjoy.Theoretically one could also collaborate with English teachers and pick samples corresponding to those classes. Ultimately, the content and origin of the dialogue doesn't really matter. Students will be using text styling to differentiate the dialogue between different characters as well as also using text-styling with the span tag to emphasize certain parts of the text. Students assignments will need to meet these requirements but are welcome to go beyond them
- Getting at least 8 lines of dialogue split between at least two or more characters
- Using the font-size property to make the text bigger and easier to read on the screen
- Use text-styling to differentiate the text of the different characters
    - Specifically, each character should at least have different font-family and color properties. 
    - At least one character should also have left-aligned text and at least one character should have right-aligned text.
    - Other CSS properties can also be used to differentiate between the characters if desired.
- Use the span tag to change the styling of certain parts of the text
    - The font-weight, font-style, and text-decoration property should each be used at least once for this purpose
    - You may also choose to change the color, size, or font of certain parts of the text if you wish
If students don't end up finishing in class, they will finish it as Homework
