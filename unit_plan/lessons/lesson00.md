## Lesson Structure

### Standards
- 9-12.DL.7
- 9-12.NSD.4
- 9-12.IC.7

### Aim:  What is the web?

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)
Do Now: What comes to mind when you think about the World Wide Web? What do you use the web for?

Students will be given 2-3 minutes to answer these questions in their notebook (or something equivalent) and potentially discuss their answers with their classmates next to them.

### Warm-Up Review (3 - 5 minutes)
After students are given some time to think of their answers to the Do Now, we'll turn this into a classwide discussion, taking time to hear students' answers to the first question of the Do Now, then the second. It may also make sense to write down their answers on the board to keep in mind throughout the class period.

### Slide Presentation (30-35 minutes)
Present the slides provided in the resources/lesson00/lesson00_slides.pdf

As this lesson in particular is more lecture style, presenting the slides will take up a majority of the time. That being said, there will be several prompts for discussions and asking students questions throughout, such as discussing the difference between "the web" vs the internet or quickly surveying what browsers students use, so that it is more interactive. 

If students have access to computers during this lesson, for part of the presentation students may also try to inspect element so that they can see the HTML code underlying websites themselves. 

### Exit Ticket / Homework (Rest of Class)
Browse the web and think about
- What’s something you’d want to learn how to do with web development
- What’s something you’d want to know about the web itself
Submit your thoughts to Google Classroom.
