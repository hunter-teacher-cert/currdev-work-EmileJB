## Lesson Structure

### Standards
- 9-12.DL.5
- 9-12.NSD.4
- 9-12.IC.6

### Aim:  How Can We Use File Paths To Add Images To Our Web Pages?

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)
Do Now: Imagine you see some cool art or a funny meme while browsing the web. How would you share that image with others? Try to describe it or write it down as a step-by-step process. Does that process change depending on any factors? (i.e. where you saw the image, if you're on your phone or a computer, who you're sending it to, etc.)

Students will be given 2-3 minutes to think about their answer to the Do Now before going over it as a class

### Warm-Up Review (3-5 minutes)
After students are given some time to think of their answers to the Do Now, we'll turn this into a classwide discussion, taking time to hear students' answers. 

If no student mentions it, demonstrate how one way to share images with others is to just send them the image URL (and demonstrate how to get an image URL in case some students don't know). Some platforms even automatically convert the URL into the image, like Discord. Use this to segue into the lesson and slides for the day

### Slide Presentation (20-25 minutes)
Present the slides provided in the materials

The slides for this lesson will cover
- The img tag
- explanation of attributes as part of HTML tag syntax
- img src attribute
- img alt attribute
- self-closing tags
- brief discussion/demonstration of how to use file explorer
- a comparison between file paths on computers and URLs (relative vs absolute file paths)
- how to reference other files whether they're in the same, child, or parent folder
- brief discussion of image file types

In addition to the slides, live demo
- Using the img tag with a URL
- The process of downloading an image and finding it in file explorer
- an example of what the activity for today might look like (Code in code/lesson03/teacher folder but a live version also exists here: https://emilejb.github.io/unit-plan-sites/lesson03/)

### Activity / Homework: My Favorite Things (Rest of Class)
After presenting the slides, students will spend the rest of class (finishing it up for HW if they need to) creating a webpage that has images of 6 of their favorite things of categories of their choice, such as favorite movie, favorite book, favorite animal, favorite holiday, etc. Students will be provided with starter code via GitHub Classroom to get started from and follow the comments in the HTML file as well as directions on the board. These instructions will also be in the readme in their starter code. Their repository will have an images folder with a picture showing how to upload to the images folder as well as an index.html with some starter code already present and comments making it clear where they add code to. The repository will also contain a style.css, but that'll be discussed more in the future. Students directions will be as follows
1. In the designated space, add a heading tag that contains the category of one of your favorite things i.e. My Favorite Movie
2. After the heading tag describing the category, add an img tag.
3. Now the fun part, search for an image that represents what your favorite thing in that category is. My favorite movie is Revenge of the Sith, so I might try to find an image of the poster for that move
4. Once you found the image you want to use, download it to your computer, then upload it to your repository. Make sure to put the image in the images folder
5. Set the src attribute for the img tag to the file path for the image you want to use
6. Set the alt attribute for the img tag to a brief description of the image
7. Underneath the img tag, add another smaller heading tag or a p tag saying what the name of the favorite thing is
8. You're not done, but now is a good point to commit/push and deploy the web page to make sure you have everything working properly so far
9. Once you've done that, repeat steps 1-8 for the remaining 5 spaces
10. When you're done with everything, submit a link to the webpage when on Google Classroom so I know that you're finished
