## Lesson Structure

### Standards
- 9-12.IC.7
- 9-12.IC.6
- 9-12.DL.5

### Aim:  What is CSS and How Can We Use It to Style Our Web Pages?

### Warm-Up (2-3 minutes)
Do Now: Think about some of the websites you've visited or seen in the past. What websites do you like the design of, and why? Or what website designs do you dislike, and why?

Students will be given 2-3 minutes to think about their answer to the Do Now and discuss it with classmates before going over it as a class.

### Warm-Up Review (3-5 minutes)
After students are given some time to think of their answers to the Do Now, we'll turn this into a classwide discussion, taking time to hear students' answers. This will be used to segue into the slides for today's lesson


### Slide Presentation (20-25 minutes)
Present the slides provided in the materials

The slides for this lesson will cover
- Brief history of CSS

- the class and id attributes
- the color and background-color properties 
- live demonstration of CSS in action
- Style tag vs style.css file

In addition to the slides, live demo
- Using the color and background-color properties by using Inspect Element
- The effect of using different selectors with the same rules by using Inspect Element
- The Color Pallette generating links
- an example of what the activity for today might look like (Code in code/lesson05/teacher folder but a live version also exists here: https://emilejb.github.io/unit-plan-sites/lesson05/)
- Demonstrate how Inspect Element can be used to experiment with values on their websites without needing to rewrite, commit, wait, and refresh

### Activity: Mini-Quiz/Trivia Pt. 2 (Rest of Class)
For today's activity students will revisit their quiz that they worked on in the previous lesson and try using a bit of CSS to add some color to it. Students will be encouraged to have fun with it but there will be some requirements for the assignment they'll be expected to meet. Those are
- Use at least two different background colors for different pages on the quiz. For example, you could make the pages for question 1 one color and pages for question 2 another, or you could split it by the correct or incorrect pages.
- The quiz actually has big flaw where it can be easy to tell what all the incorrect answers are by looking at the link colors. Make it so that all links are the same color as to not give anything away
- On the correct pages (not the one where the user picks their answer), style the answers so that the incorrect answer(s) are styled one way (maybe colored red) while the correct answer(s) are styled another way (maybe colored green)
- Consider using the links discussed and shown in class to help pick colors for your quiz if you find it hard to choose what colors to use yourself
If students don't end up finishing in class, they will finish it as Homework
