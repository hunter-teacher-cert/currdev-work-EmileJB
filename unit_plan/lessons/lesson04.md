## Lesson Structure

### Standards
- 9-12.DL.5
- 9-12.NSD.4
- 9-12.IC.7

### Aim:  How Can We Use Links To Create Websites With Multiple Pages

### Warm-Up (3-5 minutes)
Do Now: Students will be asked to play the Wikipedia game, linked here https://www.thewikipediagame.com/

Students will be given 3-5 minute to try to play the game, but they don't need to feel pressured to actually win within the timeframe. This is more of a fun segue into a discussion about how most websites on the internet are made of a collection of web pages, not just a single one.

### Slide Presentation (10-15 minutes)
Present the slides provided in the materials

The slides for this lesson are a bit short as the only new thing being learned is the a tag, although we'll alsotalk a bit about the logistics of having to deal with multiple web pages as well.

In addition, live demo an example for what the activity for today might look like. Importantly, focus on how the the site structure diagram in the slides corresponds to the experience of using the quiz site and prompt students to pay attention to the URL of each page as we click on links and go from one page to another. (Code for demo is in code/lesson04/ folder but a live version also exists here: https://emilejb.github.io/unit-plan-sites/lesson04/)

### Activity: A Mini-Quiz/Trivia (Rest of Class)
After presenting the slides, students will spend the rest of class (finishing it up for HW if they need to) creating a collection of web pages to make a mini-quiz/trivia game about whatever topic(s) of their choice. Students will be creating all the files and folders themselves from an empty repository (although the instructions below will be included in the readme.md), but they will be given a guide to follow for the organization of their files and presented with a demonstration of what the site should look like and how it should work. Students assignment will also need to meet these requirements
- The game should have an intro page before the first question briefly describing what it will be about
- The intro page should link to the first question of the quiz, which is its own page in a seperate child folder
- Each question page should include a question and at least two answers. At least one of the answers should link to a page that tells the user they answered incorrectly, and at least one of the answers should link to a page that tells the user they answered correctly
- The incorrect page should link back to the intro page for the quiz so that they have to start from the beginning
- The correct page should link to the next question, which will be in it's own child folder of the main folder
- The quiz should be made up of at least two questions, but they can do more if they wish
- Big Hint: This assignment will be much easier if student duplicate files or copy and paste their HTML code and adjust as needed
